This morning I was lying down on bed. Had a cup of tea in my hand, and was reading the newspaper. Curled up in a blanket, feeling lazy. 

Our maid Bhagya was cleaning the house. She's been with us for several years now, so she knows how lazy we are. She doesn't expect us to move even a bit, especially on a Sunday morning.

Every month or so, she takes old news papers from our home. Being lazy, we are glad someone is cleaning up for us; but for her it is extra money earned. Win-win situation.

Except, there is small hiccup. The evil security guard thinks that the maid is stealing stuff. He demands a "gate pass", a signed letter that says "Please allow Bhagya to take old newspapers". Whoever said security and convenience was possible was either drunk or doped.

Anyways, finding a sheet of paper and a pen that works on a Sunday morning, when all you want is to get some more sleep, is just impossible. "Bhagya, kal leke jaana" is what I have told her several times in the past.

Back to this morning. Bhagya nicely bundles up the old newspapers. As a bonus, she cleans up the corner where we dump newspapers. She finds a pamphlet within the newspapers, one that is blank on the reverse side. She tries a couple of pens, and magically finds one that works.

And then she comes to my bed, hands me the pen and pamphlet, smiles, and tells me "Bhaiya, gate pass bano do". I don't have to move an inch!

Small things that make your day!
